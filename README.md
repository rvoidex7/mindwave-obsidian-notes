# MindWave - A Personal Knowledge Vault

Welcome to MindWave, my personal digital garden and second brain, managed with [Obsidian](https.md.obsidian.md/). This repository serves as a synchronized backup of my notes, ideas, and thoughts, allowing me to access my knowledge base across all my devices.

## About This Vault

This repository contains my personal notes on a wide range of subjects. It is a living project, constantly growing and evolving as I learn and explore new ideas. The primary purpose of this public vault is to embrace the practice of "learning in public" and to keep a durable, version-controlled archive of my knowledge.

While the structure and some unencrypted notes are visible, please be aware of the following:

### Encryption Notice

For privacy and security, a significant portion of the notes within this vault are **end-to-end encrypted** using the [Meld Encrypt](https://github.com/meld-cp/obsidian-encrypt) plugin for Obsidian. These files will appear with a `.mdenc` extension and are unreadable without the proper decryption key.

This hybrid approach allows me to share my general thoughts and vault structure publicly while keeping sensitive and personal information completely private.

## License

The content in this repository is licensed under the **Apache License 2.0**. You are free to use, share, and adapt the unencrypted content as long as you provide appropriate credit, include the original copyright notice, and state if you have made changes.
